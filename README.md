## BlockVanishChat
A very simple Minecraft Spigot plugin to prevent vanished players from accidentally sending chat messages, and informing them if they try to.

Supports both SuperVanish/PremiumVanish (/sv or /pv) and Essentials (/vanish) 

Use the `/bvcreload` command to reload config file (containing message texts)

Use the `bvc.bypass` permission (false by default) to bypass chat blocking
